# AsyncGame
To play the game demo, log in as:
user-prab@email.com
user-noah@email.com
user-joey@email.com

All 3 users have the password "password"

The only game that can be played in the demo is game1 with these 3 users.  Creating a new game and playing game2 have not been implemented but all other features should be functional in the demo.
